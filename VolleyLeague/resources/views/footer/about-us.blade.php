            This project is intended to be a league organizator mainly focused in Beach Volleyball leagues.
            </br>
            In the current version of this project the user is able to create leagues with several teams and players and create the various matches for the league.
            </br>
            Some goal features of this project are still under work as the creation of other type of leagues, e.g. 3vs3 Basketball Leagues and more.
